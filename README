Made in New Year's Eve!

How you can use it:

Pipeline's process is started
          act0() -> res0 or act0(Init) -> res0
       => act1(res0) -> res1, res2
       => act2(res1, res2) -> res3
       => io:format("~p", res3) -> ...
       => act3() -> Result
          {ok, Result} or {error, Reason, {CurrentArg, RemainingFuns}}
Pipeline's process died

PS: Actually I don't know how it may need you =), but who knows...
